CPU consumption every minute in bash and cron 
script to check cpu utilization in linux

Put this into a bash script somewhere on your system (/opt for example
#!/bin/bash

CPU_USAGE=$(top -b -n2 -p 1 | fgrep "Cpu(s)" | tail -1 | awk -F'id,' -v prefix="$prefix" '{ split($1, vs, ","); v=vs[length(vs)]; sub("%", "", v); printf "%s%.1f%%\n", prefix, 100 - v }')
DATE=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:")
CPU_USAGE="$DATE CPU: $CPU_USAGE"
echo $CPU_USAGE >> /opt/cpu_usage.out

next

Then create a file called cpu_usage under /etc/cron.d/ with the following in:
*/1 * * * * root /opt/your_script.sh

This should execute the script once per minute, and output the CPU usage in a percentage format on a new line within the specified file
